### The fs and path modules are imported for reading and manipulating the file system.

```
import fs from "fs";
import path from "path";
```

This line gets the directory name of the current module file (the one containing this code). It uses the path module and the import.meta.url property (which is only available in ESM modules) to get the URL of the current file and extract its directory path.

```
const __dirname = path.dirname(new URL(import.meta.url).pathname);

```

This line creates a path to the public/images directory relative to the directory of the current module file.

```
const imagesDirPath = path.join(__dirname, "../../../public/images");
let images = [];
if (fs.existsSync(imagesDirPath)) {
  images = fs
    .readdirSync(imagesDirPath)
    .filter((filename) => filename.endsWith(".png"))
    .map((filename) => {
      const data = fs.readFileSync(path.join(imagesDirPath, filename), {
        encoding: "base64",
      });
      return `data:image/png;base64,${data}`;
    });
}

```

This block of code reads all the .png files in the public/images directory and converts them to base64-encoded data URLs. The fs.existsSync() method is used to check if the public/images directory exists before attempting to read it. If the directory exists, its contents are read synchronously using fs.readdirSync(). The resulting array of filenames is filtered to include only .png files. Then each file is read synchronously using fs.readFileSync(), with the encoding option set to base64 to get a base64-encoded string of the file's contents. Finally, each base64-encoded string is used to create a data URL for the corresponding image.

```
const data = [
  {
    userId: 1,
    id: 1,
    title: "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet",
    body: "this is test1",
    img: images[0],
  },
  {
    userId: 2,
    id: 2,
    title: "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet",
    body: "this is test",
    img: images[1],
  },
  {
    userId: 3,
    id: 3,
    title: "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet",
    body: "this is test",
    img: images[2],
  },
];
```

This creates an array of data objects, each containing a user ID, an ID, a title, a body, and an image URL. The image URLs are taken from the images array created earlier.

```
export default data;
```

This exports the data array as the default export of the module, so it can be imported and used in other modules.
